# My First Website: abrierley0.github.io
This *repository* is for storing the files for my first website.
I am also using this oppurtunity to quickly learn markdown;

I am a ~~pigeon~~ **_human_**!!


I have a number of **ideas** of what to include and how to grow this website:

* Introductory page
* About Me page 
* Photos (film camera)
* Blog
* Piano practice log and notes
* Essays 
* Ideas
* Links

I had a thought whilst standing waiting for coffee to boil in the kitchen in the new metal hob thingy I'm trying to use (*Instantaneous Revision: "coffee percolator"* - thanks Google old pal.) What's my obsession with creating this website? Many of the things I would like to do with it can be achieved with a *common or garden* notebook. I answered myself with this - theoretically anybody with access to a computer (including smartphones) across the planet can access this information and this website. I'm essentially **_publishing_** my thoughts, creations, ideas and dreams. Isn't that irresistible to a human being? to reach out to other people? The answer is yes, and think about your use of Instagram and Snapchat stories. This website offers a more personalised experience, with more storage for information - be that images, videos, music, writing, photos, art - whilst learning a new skill and opening doors to other skills. The infinite possibilities of this website is exciting, and I imagine had everyone else the impetus to learn how they probably would create their own too.

This begs another question. Is most social media limited in this sense? Is there a market for deeper online expression than the odd photo, comment or tweet?

There is also, however, something terrifying about this information being able to reach so many people (and non-people [AI looms over Adam's theoretical tinterweb shoulder] \*\*) but as Mr Shedd says (who the fuck is that?) "A ship in harbour is safe, but that's not why ships are built." *(Instantaneous revision: He must be American cos it was spelt 'harbor'.)((Further revision: Hopefully one day an English lit. class will analyse my use of coarse colloquialisms with admiration, and chuckle and nod heads to each other at my youthful wit))(((Further further revision: I am very conscious of how pretentious I am sounding as I write, whenever it gets too much for me to bare it seems one must ground himself with a layman's dialect {that's probably not the right one}{Instantaneous revision [courtesy of, once again, his majesty Google]: Nevermind, I was correct!!} or resort to **weak** humour {how modest of me}, however as this is a 'GitHub README.md' the masses will not be graced with such pomposity.))) What a wide selection of brackets we have!! What lucky people!!*

\*\*although, *cue interesting thought*, the more I write the more the AI will resemble me!! Excellent!! What encouragement!! What ho!! Somewhat relating to this - is **_creative_** AI a good or bad thing? - I bet, as with scientists and engineers, there is a desperate need for creative and artistic people in the computing/ online environment. Think Space Oddity vs anything any astronaut has ever created artistically. Imagine what beauty would be created if David Hockney could orbit the Earth for a bit. Big tick [Adam creatively pats himself on the back.]

I have realised I am very interested in expanding the 'rules' of writing. This is surely essential for creativity to flourish, things must be able to change and grow and adapt.

Too much coffee really does ruin the spider web; increases typing errors and inhibits concentration.
