# My First Website: abrierley0.github.io
This repository is for storing the files for my first website.
I have a number of ideas of what to include and how to grow this website:
* Introductory page

* About Me page (including progress with coding)

* Photos (film camera)

* Blog

* Piano practice log and notes

* Writing

* Links 

* Art - analysis, my own art, ASCII

* Essays
