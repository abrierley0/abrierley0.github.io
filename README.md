# My First Website: abrierley0.github.io
This *repository* is for storing the files for my first website.
I am also using this oppurtunity to quickly learn markdown.

I am a ~~pigeon~~ **_human_**!!


I have a number of **ideas** of what to include and how to grow this website:

* Introductory page
* About Me page 
* Photos (film camera)
* Blog
* Piano practice log and notes
* Links 
* Essays
